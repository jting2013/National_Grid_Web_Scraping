# National_Grid_Web_Scraping

Project is to log into National Grid Gas or Electric to get the amount due and send an email to notify if there is a payment needed.

If no amount it will not send an email.  Along this it will collect the data over time and create a plot of the amount for Gas and Electric.

Run.py is the file to kick off the application.

Config.py needs update for login credential and also the email from and to information in order to send the email. 123
